Singly Linked List Project
This project involves implementing various functions for working with singly linked lists in C. The project consists of several C source files, each of which contains a set of functions related to singly linked lists.

Project Structure
lists.h: Header file containing struct definitions and function prototypes.
0-print_list.c: Contains the implementation of the print_list function, which prints the elements of a singly linked list.
1-list_len.c: Contains the implementation of the list_len function, which returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.
2-add_node.c: Contains the implementation of the add_node function, which adds a new node to the beginning of a singly linked list.
3-add_node_end.c: Contains the implementation of the add_node_end function, which adds a new node to the end of a singly linked list.
4-free_list.c: Contains the implementation of the free_list function, which frees the memory allocated for a singly linked list.
Requirements
Before compiling and running the code, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

Development environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Compiler: gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., is forbidden.
You are allowed to use _putchar, but you don't need to push _putchar.c.
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file lists.h.
All your header files should be include guarded.
